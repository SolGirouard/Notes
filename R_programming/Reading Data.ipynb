    "\n",
    "The `read.table` function is one of th emost commonly used functions for reading data. It has a few important arguments:\n",
    "* `file` - the name of a file\n",
    "* `header` - logical (True/False) indicating if the file has a header line (first line has variable names or is data\n",
    "* `sep` - a string indicating how the columns are separated (',' or ';' or ' ')\n",
    "* `colClasses` - a characer vector indicating the class of each column in the dataset\n",
    "* `nrows` - the number of rows in the dataset \n",
    "* `comment.char` - a character string indicating the comment character (anything after this character will be treated as a comment)\n",
    "* `skip` the number of lines to skip from the beginning\n",
    "* `stringAsFactors` - should character variables be coded as factors?"

    "* Set `comment.char = \"\"` if there are no commented lines in your file\n",
    "* Use the colClasses argument, it's much faster (up to twice as fast). A quick and dirty way to figure out the classes of each column is the following:\n",
    "    * `initial <- read.table(\"datatable.txt\", nrows = 100)`\n",
    "    * `classes <- sapply(initial, class)`\n",
